                <p class="lead">Note-taking provides several benefits beyond that record of what was presented in a lecture or class activity. <b>Effective notetaking</b> keeps you alert. Notetaking keeps your body active and involved and helps you avoid feelings of drowsiness or distraction. Listening carefully and deciding what to include in notes <b>keeps your mind actively involved</b> with what you hear. As you take notes, you'll decide on and highlight the key ideas you hear, identifying the structure of a class presentation. You'll also be able to indicate the supporting points of a presentation, <b>making study and understanding easier</b> after class. Such organized notes also make it easier for you to link classroom learning to textbook readings.</p>

                <p class="lead">The user will access the applications through the device of their choice, commonly via a laptop or tablet. Some note-taking applications are available cross-platform and on multiple devices while others may be limited to one platform or device. For example, Notability is only available within Apple products whereas OneNote markets their availability across all platforms and devices.</p>

                        blow your mind.</span></h2>
                <p class="lead">One of the advantages of using note-taking applications are their relatively low cost to use. Most apps are free or have a low subscription fee, which may offset the price of buying paper or notebooks for each course. To use the applications however, the user must already own a device such as a laptop or tablet, which can be costly to buy on its own. Most students like to keep digital copies of notes and tend to scan their notes. This leads to poor image quality and inefficiency in studying. Note-taking apps allow students to forego the middle step. For this reason, the Office of Disability Services prefers that students use note-taking apps instead of scanning their notes, as note-taking apps can provide notes that are more clear and easier to read.</p>
